          I’m a passionate Full Stack Web Developer and Software Engineer with
          experience ranging from high-profile internships to hands-on
          development roles. I’ve had the privilege of working as a software
          engineer intern at Microsoft and Allstate, where I gained invaluable
          insights into the tech industry. Additionally, my role as a Full Stack
          Web Developer for two departments at the University of Illinois at
          Chicago allowed me to contribute to impactful projects and collaborate
          with diverse teams.

          In my spare time, I indulge in console modding, a hobby that keeps my
          problem-solving skills sharp and fuels my creativity. This blend of
          professional experience and personal passion drives my commitment to
          technology.
          <br />
          <br />
          My mission is to inspire and encourage others to dive into the tech
          field. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and showcasing
          work, and I am dedicated to fostering a community where emerging
          talents can thrive and learn from each other.
          <br />
